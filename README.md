# UniFi Protect Time-lapse (API-based)

A modern, API-based solution for creating time-lapse videos from UniFi Protect cameras. This application uses the UniFi Protect REST API to capture camera snapshots at configurable intervals and compiles them into high-quality time-lapse videos.

## Overview

UniFi Protect Time-lapse connects to your UniFi Protect system via its REST API to capture camera snapshots at configurable intervals. These snapshots are then automatically compiled into time-lapse videos daily, giving you a condensed view of what happened throughout the day.

### Key Improvements in This Version

- **API-based**: Uses UniFi Protect's REST API instead of RTSP streams for much better reliability
- **Rate-Limit Aware**: Automatically respects UniFi Protect's 10 req/sec rate limit with intelligent camera distribution
- **Simplified Configuration**: No more complex stream IDs - just use camera names
- **Automatic Camera Discovery**: Discovers all cameras automatically from your UniFi Protect system
- **Smart Quality Detection**: Automatically detects which cameras support high-quality snapshots
- **Better Error Handling**: Comprehensive retry logic and graceful handling of disconnected cameras
- **Flexible Camera Selection**: Whitelist, blacklist, or capture all cameras
- **Modern Architecture**: Built with async/await for high performance

### Features

- **Rate Limit Compliance**: Automatically calculates optimal timing to stay within UniFi Protect's API limits
- **Intelligent Camera Distribution**: Spreads camera requests across time to avoid overwhelming the system
- **Multiple Capture Intervals**: Configure different capture frequencies (e.g., every 60 seconds, every 3 minutes)
- **Automatic Camera Discovery**: No need for manual stream ID configuration
- **Smart Quality Selection**: Uses high-quality snapshots when cameras support it
- **System Validation**: Validates configuration against rate limits before starting
- **Detailed Status Summaries**: Get regular summaries showing success rates and performance for each camera
- **Configurable Video Quality**: Choose between different video quality presets or create custom settings
- **Flexible Camera Selection**: Choose which cameras to include via whitelist, blacklist, or capture all
- **Flexible Scheduling**: Set when time-lapses are created
- **Docker-Based**: Easy deployment using Docker

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose
- UniFi Protect system with API access
- API key from your UniFi Protect system

### Getting Your API Key

1. Log in to your UniFi Protect web interface
2. Go to **Control Plane** → **Integrations** → **Your API Keys**
3. Click **Generate API Key**
4. Give it a descriptive name (e.g., "Time-lapse Service")
5. Copy the generated API key - you'll need this for configuration

### Deployment

1. Create a `compose.yaml` file:

```yaml
name: unifi_protect_time_lapse

services:
  unifi_protect_time_lapse:
    container_name: unifi_protect_time_lapse
    image: lux4rd0/unifi_protect_time_lapse:latest
    restart: always
    volumes:
      - ./output:/app/unifi_protect_time_lapse/output:rw

2. Replace `your_api_key_here` with your actual API key
3. Replace `your-protect-host` with your UniFi Protect hostname/IP
4. Run `docker compose up -d`

**Note**: The first startup may take a few minutes as Docker downloads the image and initializes the system. Subsequent starts are much faster thanks to optimized caching.

## Environmental Variables

### Core API Configuration

| Variable | Description | Default | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|---------|
| `UNIFI_PROTECT_API_KEY` | **Required**: API key from UniFi Protect | - | `0hOcBk-nofd7...` |
| `UNIFI_PROTECT_BASE_URL` | **Required**: Base URL to UniFi Protect API | - | `https://unifi.local/proxy/protect/integration/v1` |
| `UNIFI_PROTECT_VERIFY_SSL` | Whether to verify SSL certificates | `false` | `true` |
| `UNIFI_PROTECT_REQUEST_TIMEOUT` | Request timeout in seconds | `30` | `60` |
| `CAMERA_REFRESH_INTERVAL` | How often to check for new/reconnected cameras (seconds) | `300` | `60` |
| `SNAPSHOT_HIGH_QUALITY` | Request high resolution snapshots when supported | `true` | `false` |

### Rate Limiting Configuration

| Variable | Description | Default | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|---------|
| `UNIFI_PROTECT_RATE_LIMIT` | UniFi Protect's API rate limit (requests per second) | `10` | `15` |
| `RATE_LIMIT_SAFETY_BUFFER` | Percentage of rate limit to use (0.0-1.0) | `0.8` | `0.9` |

### Camera Configuration

| Variable | Description | Default | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|---------|
| `CAMERA_SELECTION_MODE` | Camera selection method | `all` | `whitelist`, `blacklist` |
| `CAMERA_WHITELIST` | JSON array of camera names to include (whitelist mode) | `[]` | `'["Front Door", "Garage"]'` |
| `CAMERA_BLACKLIST` | JSON array of camera names to exclude (blacklist mode) | `[]` | `'["Private Cam"]'` |
| `FETCH_INTERVALS` | JSON array of capture intervals in seconds | `[10, 60]` | `[30, 300, 900]` |

This release adds support for multiple PTZ presets per camera and an optional return-to-home behavior. Use the `CAMERA_PRESETS` environment variable to provide a JSON mapping of camera display names to preset dictionaries. Each preset dictionary maps a logical preset name to a preset index (or `null` to just capture without moving). Example:

```yaml
CAMERA_PRESETS: '{"Front Door Cam": {"Default": null, "CloseUp": 1, "Wide": 2}, "Garage Cam": {"Default": null}}'
CAMERA_PTZ_RETURN_TO_HOME: "true"  # Return camera to Home preset (-1) after all presets run
CAMERA_PTZ_PRESET_DELAY: "2.0"     # Seconds to wait after moving to a preset
```

When presets are configured, captured images are stored under the camera directory suffixed with the preset name, for example: `images/Front_Door_Cam-CloseUp/60s/...`.

Note that preset numbers are unfortunately not obvious. The "Home" preset is always -1, and other presets take indices numbered 0,1,2, etc. However those slot numbers do not necessarily have to bear any relation to the preset numbers shown in the Protect UI.  When you create a preset in the Protect UI, the index number it is given is the lowest currently available. Whenever you delete presets their indices are freed. The preset number shown in the Protect UI is completely different: it is 1,2,3 etc, where "1" is the preset you created first (while this will often be preset index-0, if you have deleted presets this is not necessarily true), "2" is the preset you created second, etc. If you never delete presets then things are easy: subtract 1 from the number shown in the Protect UI to get the preset index number needed by this configuration.

## Rate Limit Management

This application automatically manages UniFi Protect's API rate limits (10 requests per second) through several mechanisms:

### Automatic Rate Limit Detection

The system automatically:
- Detects how many intervals might execute simultaneously
- Calculates safe concurrent limits based on your camera count
- Warns if your configuration might exceed rate limits
- Suggests optimal settings for your deployment size

### Camera Distribution

For larger deployments (4+ cameras), the system can automatically distribute camera requests across time when needed:

```
Example with 12 cameras:
21:30:00 - Cameras 1-4 capture
21:30:05 - Cameras 5-8 capture  
21:30:10 - Cameras 9-12 capture
```

**Important**: Distribution is only enabled when it provides a benefit. With small deployments or when concurrent limits are sufficient, all cameras capture simultaneously for optimal performance.

This ensures you never exceed the 10 req/sec limit while maintaining precise timing.

### Rate Limit Configuration Examples

**Small deployment (≤5 cameras):**
```yaml
FETCH_CONCURRENT_LIMIT_MODE: "auto"        # System calculates optimal limits
FETCH_ENABLE_CAMERA_DISTRIBUTION: "auto"   # Only enables if beneficial
```
*Result: All cameras capture simultaneously - no distribution needed*

**Medium deployment (6-15 cameras):**
```yaml
FETCH_CONCURRENT_LIMIT_MODE: "auto"        # System calculates optimal limits  
FETCH_ENABLE_CAMERA_DISTRIBUTION: "auto"   # Enables distribution when helpful
```
*Result: Cameras distributed across 2-3 time slots as needed*

**Large deployment (20+ cameras):**
```yaml
UNIFI_PROTECT_RATE_LIMIT: "10"            # UniFi's actual limit
RATE_LIMIT_SAFETY_BUFFER: "0.8"           # Use 80% for safety
FETCH_ENABLE_CAMERA_DISTRIBUTION: "true"   # Always enable distribution
FETCH_DISTRIBUTION_STRATEGY: "adaptive"    # Calculate optimal timing
```
*Result: Cameras distributed across multiple time slots to respect rate limits*

### Handling Disconnected Cameras

**Important**: Distribution settings are locked at startup based on **all discovered cameras** (including disconnected ones). This ensures consistent timing if cameras reconnect, but you have options:

**Option 1: Optimize for current cameras (recommended for permanently offline cameras)**
```yaml
# Remove disconnected cameras from whitelist - system optimizes for remaining cameras
CAMERA_WHITELIST: '["Garage Cam", "Pergola North Cam", "Front Door Cam"]'  # Only connected cameras
```

**Option 2: Reserve slots for reconnecting cameras (recommended for temporarily offline cameras)**
```yaml  
# Keep disconnected cameras in whitelist - system reserves their timing slots
CAMERA_WHITELIST: '["Garage Cam", "Offline Cam", "Pergola North Cam", "Front Door Cam"]'  # All cameras
```

**Option 3: Override concurrent limits to disable distribution**
```yaml
FETCH_CONCURRENT_LIMIT_MODE: "manual"      # Manual override
FETCH_CONCURRENT_LIMIT_MANUAL: "10"        # High enough to capture all cameras simultaneously
```

**Custom rate limiting:**
```yaml
FETCH_CONCURRENT_LIMIT_MODE: "manual"      # Manual control
FETCH_CONCURRENT_LIMIT_MANUAL: "3"         # Never more than 3 simultaneous requests
```

## Camera Selection Examples

### Capture All Cameras
```yaml
CAMERA_SELECTION_MODE: "all"
```

### Whitelist Specific Cameras
```yaml
CAMERA_SELECTION_MODE: "whitelist"
CAMERA_WHITELIST: '["Front Door Cam", "Garage Cam", "Backyard Cam"]'
```

### Blacklist Specific Cameras
```yaml
CAMERA_SELECTION_MODE: "blacklist"
CAMERA_BLACKLIST: '["Private Bedroom Cam", "Office Camera"]'
```

## Usage Commands

The application supports several command-line modes for testing and manual operation:

### Validate System Configuration
```bash
docker exec your_container python3 main.py validate
```
This checks if your configuration will exceed rate limits before starting.

### Test Camera Connectivity
```bash
docker exec your_container python3 main.py test
```

### Create Time-lapse Videos Now
```bash
docker exec your_container python3 main.py create
```

### Run Only Image Capture
```bash
docker exec your_container python3 main.py fetch
```

### Run Only Video Creation
```bash
docker exec your_container python3 main.py timelapse
```

## System Status and Monitoring

### Startup Validation

The application validates your configuration at startup:

```
✅ Rate limit compliance: Configuration should stay within limits
✅ System capacity validation passed

Connected cameras: 15
Max simultaneous intervals: 2
Effective concurrent limit: 4
Rate limit analysis: limit=10 req/sec, effective=8 req/sec, max_intervals=2, concurrent_limit=4
```

### Camera Distribution Logging

When camera distribution is enabled, you'll see detailed slot assignments:

```
Camera distribution ENABLED: 15 cameras, strategy: adaptive, offset: 8s
Camera slot assignments (deterministic):
  Slot 0 (+0s): Front Door Cam, Garage Cam, Backyard Cam, Kitchen Cam
  Slot 1 (+8s): Living Room Cam, Bedroom Cam, Office Cam, Basement Cam
  Slot 2 (+16s): Patio Cam, Driveway Cam, Side Yard Cam

# Or for smaller deployments:
Camera distribution DISABLED: 4 cameras (no distribution needed)
```

### Interval-Specific Logging

All operations are clearly tagged by interval:

```
[60s] Captured 15/15 connected cameras (distributed across 3 groups, 8s offset)
[180s] Captured 15/15 connected cameras (distributed across 3 groups, 8s offset)

# Or for smaller deployments:
[60s] Captured 4/4 connected cameras (no distribution)
[180s] Captured 4/4 connected cameras (no distribution)
```

### Rate Limit Headers

The application logs UniFi Protect's rate limit headers so you can monitor usage:

```
RateLimit-Policy: "10-in-1sec"; q=10; w=1
RateLimit: "10-in-1sec"; r=6; t=1    # 6 requests remaining this second
```

## Docker Volume Structure

Images and videos are stored in the following structure:

```
output/
├── images/
│   └── [camera_name]/
│       └── [interval]s/
│           └── YYYY/MM/DD/
│               └── [camera_name]_[timestamp].jpg
└── videos/
    └── YYYY/MM/
        └── [camera_name]/
            └── [interval]s/
                └── [camera_name]_YYYYMMDD_[interval]s.mp4
```

```

## Advanced Configuration

### High Quality Video Settings
For maximum quality videos (larger file sizes):
```yaml
FFMPEG_CRF: "18"                    # Higher quality
FFMPEG_PRESET: "slow"               # Better compression
FFMPEG_PIXEL_FORMAT: "yuv444p"     # Full color information
```

### Fast Processing Settings
For faster processing (lower quality):
```yaml
FFMPEG_CRF: "28"                    # Lower quality
FFMPEG_PRESET: "fast"               # Faster encoding
FFMPEG_CONCURRENT_CREATION: "4"    # More parallel jobs
```

### Custom Interval Examples
```yaml
# Multiple intervals for different purposes
FETCH_INTERVALS: '[30, 300, 900]'   # 30s, 5min, 15min

# High frequency for detailed capture
FETCH_INTERVALS: '[10, 60]'         # 10s, 1min

# Low frequency for overview
FETCH_INTERVALS: '[300, 3600]'      # 5min, 1hour
```

### Large Deployment Settings
For deployments with 20+ cameras:
```yaml
# Rate limiting
UNIFI_PROTECT_RATE_LIMIT: "10"
RATE_LIMIT_SAFETY_BUFFER: "0.7"           # More conservative buffer

# Camera distribution
FETCH_ENABLE_CAMERA_DISTRIBUTION: "true"   # Always enable
FETCH_DISTRIBUTION_STRATEGY: "adaptive"    # Auto-calculate timing
FETCH_DISTRIBUTION_WINDOW_SECONDS: "120"   # Spread across 2 minutes

# Concurrent limits
FETCH_CONCURRENT_LIMIT_MODE: "manual"      # Manual control
FETCH_CONCURRENT_LIMIT_MANUAL: "3"         # Conservative limit
```

### Multiple Site Deployment
To monitor multiple UniFi Protect sites, create separate services:

```yaml
name: unifi_protect_time_lapse_multi

services:
  site_main:
    container_name: unifi_protect_time_lapse_main
    image: lux4rd0/unifi_protect_time_lapse:latest
    volumes:
      - ./output_main:/app/unifi_protect_time_lapse/output:rw
    environment:
      UNIFI_PROTECT_API_KEY: "main_site_api_key"
      UNIFI_PROTECT_BASE_URL: "https://main.example.com/proxy/protect/integration/v1"
      # ... other settings
      
  site_remote:
    container_name: unifi_protect_time_lapse_remote
    image: lux4rd0/unifi_protect_time_lapse:latest
    volumes:
      - ./output_remote:/app/unifi_protect_time_lapse/output:rw
    environment:
      UNIFI_PROTECT_API_KEY: "remote_site_api_key"
      UNIFI_PROTECT_BASE_URL: "https://remote.example.com/proxy/protect/integration/v1"
      # ... other settings
```

## Monitoring and Status

### Detailed Status Summaries

The application provides detailed summaries at configurable intervals showing:

- Overall success and failure rates
- Per-camera performance statistics
- Number of connected vs disconnected cameras
- Image quality information (HD vs Standard)
- Rate limit compliance status

Example summary:
```
Fetch Summary (last 60.0 minutes):
  60s: 358/360 successful (99.4%), last: 09:59:50
    Front_Door_Cam: 358/360 (99.4%)
    Garage_Cam: 360/360 (100.0%)
  180s: 120/120 successful (100.0%), last: 09:57:00

Rate limit analysis: limit=10 req/sec, effective=8 req/sec, max_intervals=2, concurrent_limit=4
```

### Camera Status Information

At startup and during operation, you'll see detailed camera information:
```
Available cameras: "Front Door Cam", "Garage Cam", "Backyard Cam"
  ✓ Front Door Cam (CONNECTED) - G4-Doorbell [HD]
  ✓ Garage Cam (CONNECTED) - G4-Pro [HD]  
  ✗ Backyard Cam (DISCONNECTED) - G3-Instant [SD]

Camera distribution ENABLED: 3 cameras, strategy: adaptive, offset: 15s
Rate limit analysis: limit=10 req/sec, effective=8 req/sec, max_intervals=2, concurrent_limit=4
```

Legend:
- `✓` = Connected camera
- `✗` = Disconnected camera  
- `[HD]` = Supports high-quality snapshots
- `[SD]` = Standard quality only

## Troubleshooting

### API Connection Issues

**No cameras discovered:**
- Verify your API key is correct
- Check that the base URL is accessible
- Ensure your UniFi Protect system supports the integration API

**API key errors:**
- Go to Control Plane → Integrations → Your API Keys in UniFi Protect
- Generate a new API key
- Make sure the API key has the necessary permissions

### Rate Limit Issues

**System validation fails with rate limit warnings:**
```
⚠️  Rate limit risk: 20 req/sec > 10 req/sec
   Consider enabling camera distribution or reducing camera count
```

Solutions:
- Enable camera distribution: `FETCH_ENABLE_CAMERA_DISTRIBUTION: "true"`
- Increase distribution window: `FETCH_DISTRIBUTION_WINDOW_SECONDS: "120"`
- Use manual concurrent limits: `FETCH_CONCURRENT_LIMIT_MODE: "manual"`

**Getting 429 "Too Many Requests" errors:**
- Check rate limit headers in logs
- Reduce concurrent limit: `FETCH_CONCURRENT_LIMIT_MANUAL: "3"`
- Increase safety buffer: `RATE_LIMIT_SAFETY_BUFFER: "0.6"`

### Camera Issues

**Cameras not being captured:**
- Check camera selection mode and whitelist/blacklist settings
- Verify camera names match exactly (check logs for "Available cameras")
- Ensure cameras are connected and online in UniFi Protect

**Some cameras fail with "400 Bad Request":**
- This usually means the camera doesn't support high-quality snapshots
- The application will automatically detect this and use standard quality
- Check logs for `[HD]` vs `[SD]` indicators

### Video Creation Issues

**No videos created:**
- Check that images were captured successfully
- Verify there are enough images for the time period
- Check container logs for FFmpeg errors
- Ensure sufficient disk space

**Video quality issues:**
- Adjust `FFMPEG_CRF` (lower values = higher quality)
- Change `FFMPEG_PRESET` to "slow" for better compression
- Use `yuv444p` pixel format for full color information

### Performance Issues

**Slow container startup:**
- First startup is normal (downloading image layers)
- Subsequent starts should be much faster
- Check available disk space for Docker images

**High API load:**
- Increase `CAMERA_REFRESH_INTERVAL` to check for cameras less frequently
- Enable camera distribution to spread requests over time
- Use longer capture intervals

**Slow video creation:**
- Increase `FFMPEG_CONCURRENT_CREATION` for more parallel jobs
- Use faster presets like "fast" or "veryfast"
- Consider using a higher CRF value for faster encoding

### Network Issues

**SSL certificate errors:**
```yaml
UNIFI_PROTECT_VERIFY_SSL: "false"
```

**Timeout issues:**
```yaml
UNIFI_PROTECT_REQUEST_TIMEOUT: "60"  # Increase timeout
```

**Connection refused:**
- Verify the UniFi Protect hostname/IP is correct
- Check that the integration API is enabled
- Ensure network connectivity between Docker and UniFi Protect

## Migration from RTSP Version

If you're migrating from the older RTSP-based version:

### Configuration Changes

1. **Replace RTSP settings with API settings:**
   ```yaml
   # Old RTSP settings (remove these)
   # UNIFI_PROTECT_TIME_LAPSE_PROTECT_HOST: unifi.local
   # UNIFI_PROTECT_TIME_LAPSE_PROTECT_PORT: '7441'
   
   # New API settings (add these)
   UNIFI_PROTECT_API_KEY: "your_api_key_here"
   UNIFI_PROTECT_BASE_URL: "https://unifi.local/proxy/protect/integration/v1"
   ```

2. **Add rate limiting configuration:**
   ```yaml
   # New rate limiting features
   UNIFI_PROTECT_RATE_LIMIT: "10"
   RATE_LIMIT_SAFETY_BUFFER: "0.8"
   FETCH_CONCURRENT_LIMIT_MODE: "auto"
   FETCH_ENABLE_CAMERA_DISTRIBUTION: "auto"
   ```

3. **Simplify camera configuration:**
   ```yaml
   # Old complex camera config (remove this)
   # UNIFI_PROTECT_TIME_LAPSE_CAMERAS_CONFIG: '[{"name":"cam-front","stream_id":"abc123","intervals":[60]}]'
   
   # New simple config (add these)
   CAMERA_SELECTION_MODE: "whitelist"
   CAMERA_WHITELIST: '["Front Door Cam"]'
   FETCH_INTERVALS: '[60]'
   ```

4. **Update environment variable names:**
   - Most variables have been simplified (remove `UNIFI_PROTECT_TIME_LAPSE_` prefix)
   - Check the environmental variables table above for current names

### Benefits of Migration

- **99% more reliable** - no more RTSP connection issues
- **Rate limit compliance** - automatically respects API limits
- **Optimized Docker builds** - faster subsequent builds with layer caching
- **Simpler configuration** - no manual stream ID management
- **Better performance** - direct API calls instead of video stream processing  
- **Automatic discovery** - finds cameras automatically
- **Smart quality** - uses best quality each camera supports
- **Better error handling** - comprehensive retry and recovery logic
- **System validation** - warns about configuration issues before they cause problems
